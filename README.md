# Generative-AI-Projects

Welcome to my Generative AI project portfolio! This repository showcases three advanced projects that harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal interaction, and function calling. Each project is designed to solve real-world challenges using the latest techniques in AI and prompt engineering.

###  Projects Included
1. 🤖 Multi-Modal Customer Support Agent with Function Calling

An AI-powered customer support agent capable of handling both text and image inputs, performing backend operations via function calling.

🚀 Features:
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision and LangChain to interpret both text and image queries.
- Integrates function calling to fetch user data, order status, and FAQs from simulated APIs.
- Real-time context memory and conversation flow using LangChain's ConversationalRetrievalChain.

🧰 Tech Stack:
OpenAI, LangChain, Python, Gradio, Whisper, Function Calling, TTS, PIL, WhisperX

2. 🧠 AI Knowledge Worker using RAG for Company Expertise

A smart assistant capable of answering any company-related queries by retrieving information from internal documents.

🔍 Features:
- Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, ChromaDB and HuggingFace embeddings.
- Context-aware answers from internal documentation and SOPs.
- Fast, scalable, and secure—ideal for internal enterprise use.

🧰 Tech Stack:
LangChain, OpenAI, ChromaDB, PDFLoader, HuggingFace, Streamlit, Prompt Templates

3. 🔄 Python to Optimized C++ Code Converter using LLMs

A tool that translates Python scripts into highly optimized and idiomatic C++ code using LLMs.

⚙️ Features:
- Prompts engineered to handle complex Python code structures and performance-oriented C++ translation.
- Includes examples, validation checks, and multiple layers of abstraction control.
- Ideal for data scientists or engineers moving from Python prototyping to C++ deployment.

🧰 Tech Stack:
OpenAI, Prompt Engineering, Python, LangChain, Streamlit, code-davinci
